1 Data Merging Basics
Learn how you can merge disparate data using inner joins. By combining information from multiple sources you’ll uncover compelling insights that may have previously been hidden. 
You’ll also learn how the relationship between those sources, such as one-to-one or one-to-many, can affect your result.

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid')

# Print the column names of the taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)
